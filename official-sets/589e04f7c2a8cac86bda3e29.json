Peanuts are not actually nuts at all, they belong to the legume family. They are grown in the southern U.S. states starting in Virginia, extending down through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida and extending as far west as Texas and New Mexico.  Peanut farmers plant in the spring beginning in April and harvest them in the fall, usually starting in September.  The peanut plant produces a yellow flower that self-pollinates and forms a peg that pushes down into the soil.  Each peg develops into a peanut pod.  The peanuts grow and mature until they are ready to be harvested.  Harvest begins with a machine that cuts the plants’ tap root, lifts the plant out of the ground, shakes loose any remaining soil and flips the plant upside down so that the peanuts can dry in the sun.  The peanuts are then pulled off the vines and shipped to local peanut processors for further drying, shelling and storage.  The shelled, cleaned and sized peanuts are then shipped to the Reese plant in Hershey, PA, where we roast them ourselves.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.57546990000002,30.9037995]},"__v":2,"last_updated":"2017-03-09T13:53:35.047Z","videos":["nImqHTigd5Y"],"options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e04fa573f09a36b5e643b","name":"Milk Fat","related_set":"589e04f7c2a8cac86bda3e29","type":"supplier","address":"South Canterbury New Zealand","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/6MTF0pwsSwaSIC9VCTSX"],"what":"Milk Fat","description":"Milk fat is the naturally occurring fat found in milk, and it is also sometimes referred to as butter fat.

He began making his famed Peanut Butter Cups as part of a large candy assortment around 1928 and the company began to take off in the mid 1930s.  Since the beginning, the company enjoyed a close relationship with Hershey Chocolate and Hershey supplied all of Reese's chocolate coating.  Company growth led to the need for more manufacturing space, and in 1957 a new and modern manufacturing facility on West Chocolate Avenue opened.  Mr. Reese died in 1956 and his six sons sold the company to Hershey Chocolate Corporation in 1963.

As defined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA), chocolate must contain between 50%-60% (by weight) cocoa butter (cacao fat), and may also be called unsweetened chocolate, baking chocolate, bitter chocolate, or chocolate liquor (it does not contain alcohol).  Cocoa beans are actually the fruit of the cacao tree, and come from pods that grow on the side of the trees.   Most of the world's cacao is grown in a narrow belt 10 degrees on either side of the Equator because the trees grow well in humid tropical climates with regular rains and a short dry season.  The main cocoa growing regions are West Africa (Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria), South America (Ecuador, Peru and Brazil), and Asia. The mature pods are harvested from the trees, split open and the cocoa beans and pulp removed.  They are fermented and dried, then shelled.  Most cocoa farms are small and family run, under 10 acres in size.  Hershey is committed to having 100% certified and sustainably sourced cocoa by 2020.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.7952675,-0.8444153]},"__v":2,"last_updated":"2017-02-14T20:13:47.375Z","videos":["koc3QW3jbsI"],"options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e035942e9f36718c71b78","name":"Cocoa Co-op","related_set":"589e04f7c2a8cac86bda3e29","type":"cooperative","address":"Oume, Côte d'Ivoire","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/o8mZpDqQFONKF0k03loA"],"what":"Cocoa Co-op","description":"**CABING Cocoa Cooperative**<p>\nIn 2012, The Hershey Company (Hershey) began its Learn to Grow (LTG) farmer training program with the objective of improving cocoa farm productivity and farmer livelihoods promoting greater farmer incomes and resulting investments in farming families.\n\nProject Objectives: Increase farmer production, invest in community development, actively engage in systems to improve labor practices.\n\n**Learn to Grow Cooperatives**: We encourage long-term commitment and investment in a sustainable supply chain and the development of strategic partnerships to improve the livelihoods of cocoa farmers and their communities.

The harvest begins in mid-to-late autumn when sugar content is at its peak.  The leafy sugar beet tops are sliced off and the roots are lifted out of the ground with special harvesting equipment.  The beets are then trucked from the field to local receiving stations to be weighed, sampled and tested for sugar quality.  The beets are washed and then sliced into thin strips.  A diffusing process is next to extract the raw beet sugar juice, which is filtered and boiled down to a thick syrup.  The syrup is boiled again and when crystals begin to form, they are separated from the syrup, washed and ready for packaging.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-96.76780389999999,46.8737648]},"__v":2,"last_updated":"2018-02-28T16:12:54.959Z","options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"589e05b7ddbfd4cf07fa3068","name":"Cocoa Co-op","related_set":"589e04f7c2a8cac86bda3e29","type":"cooperative","address":"Toumodi, Côte d'Ivoire","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/I5eoUiBxQAuyRrow9ms8"],"what":"Cocoa Co-op","description":"**COOPAK Cocoa Cooperative**<p>\nIn 2012, The Hershey Company (Hershey) began its Learn to Grow (LTG) farmer training program with the objective of improving cocoa farm productivity and farmer livelihoods promoting greater farmer incomes and resulting investments in farming families.\n\nProject Objectives: Increase farmer production, invest in community development, actively engage in systems to improve labor practices.\n\n**Learn to Grow Cooperatives**: We encourage long-term commitment and investment in a sustainable supply chain and the development of strategic partnerships to improve the livelihoods of cocoa farmers and their communities.

Peanuts are not actually nuts at all, they belong to the legume family. They are grown in the southern U.S. states starting in Virginia, extending down through the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida and extending as far west as Texas and New Mexico.  Peanut farmers plant in the spring beginning in April and harvest them in the fall, usually starting in September.  The peanut plant produces a yellow flower that self-pollinates and forms a peg that pushes down into the soil.  Each peg develops into a peanut pod.  The peanuts grow and mature until they are ready to be harvested.  Harvest begins with a machine that cuts the plants’ tap root, lifts the plant out of the ground, shakes loose any remaining soil and flips the plant upside down so that the peanuts can dry in the sun.  The peanuts are then pulled off the vines and shipped to local peanut processors for further drying, shelling and storage.  The shelled, cleaned and sized peanuts are then shipped to the Reese plant in Hershey, PA, where we roast them ourselves.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-99.73314390000002,32.4487364]},"__v":7,"last_updated":"2018-02-28T16:11:48.951Z","videos":[],"options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e05b8ddbfd4cf07fa306b","name":"Cocoa Butter to West Reese Plant","from_id":"589e05b7ddbfd4cf07fa3065","to_id":"589e05b7ddbfd4cf07fa3066","related_set":"589e04f7c2a8cac86bda3e29","type":"link","__v":0,"to":"Reese Plant","options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"589e04f9c2a8cac86bda3e2a","name":"Cocoa","related_set":"589e04f7c2a8cac86bda3e29","type":"supplier","address":"Kumasi, Ghana","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/EDbU27vHRc64UDkBxFtP"],"what":"Cocoa","description":"Chocolate is a liquid or paste that is produced when cocoa beans are finely ground.
