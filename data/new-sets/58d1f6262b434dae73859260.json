The Mayamiko Lab project was set up by Mayamiko Trust, a charity established in 2008 by Paola Masperi. After extensive travel in Africa, Paola decided to help some of the most disadvantaged people in Malawi by supporting their creative talents and turning them into sustainable activities. The Mayamiko Lab was designed to provide skills training, education, nutrition, sanitation and promote fairer trade practices. Currently the project provides training in sewing and tailoring to local, disadvantaged women, who are affected by the HIV pandemic or who are carers of HIV orphans. As part of Mayamiko Trust we are happy to say that part of our profits are used to help the charity continue their amazing work in Malawi. \n\nTo find out more about how Mayamiko changes lives, read some of the stories of the Mayamiko trainees and Mayamiko Team Members\n\nThe Mayamiko fashion brand keeps graduates and local staff in employment paying living wages and adhering to our Ethical Promise. We also fully fund the workshop activities and reinvest in the growth of our workshops, so that more people can be employed and lifted out of poverty. Additionally we make a donation of £1 for each garment sold directly to Mayamiko Trust. \n\nHaving realised the impact of our work on each individual and the community, Mayamiko is working behind the scenes on new exciting projects in other parts of the world, fusing social and community support with business and entrepreneurship. Watch this space for more updates on how our brand continues to create a positive impact.","options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"58d1f7e08059f3fd66c274a5","from_id":"58d1f6ab9ee3b1226fb6c128","to_id":"58d1f6789ee3b1226fb6c127","related_set":"58d1f6262b434dae73859260","type":"link","__v":0,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58d1f82dfee87d626f82cc0e","from_id":"58d1f658dface7c873593de6","to_id":"58d1f6ab9ee3b1226fb6c128","related_set":"58d1f6262b434dae73859260","type":"link","__v":2,"last_updated":"2017-03-22T04:08:30.198Z","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/WvKIpwQrSxKwbtZVfixL"],"videos":["bpuw3oXnkmg"],"description":"","options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58d1f658dface7c873593de6","name":"Mantis World","related_set":"58d1f6262b434dae73859260","type":"supplier","pictures":[],"videos":[],"what":"GOTS Certified tshirt","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.26308459999996,-2.758363399999999],"place_id":"ChIJAXA6kENnMRgRU0ESZivtD9c"},"address":"Arusha Region, Tanzania","google_places":{"address_components":[{"long_name":"Arusha Region","short_name":"Arusha Region","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"Tanzania","short_name":"TZ","types":["country","political"]}],"adr_address":"Arusha Region, <span class=\"country-name\">Tanzania</span>","formatted_address":"Arusha Region, Tanzania","geometry":{"location":{"lat":-2.758363399999999,"lng":36.26308459999996},"viewport":{"south":-4.100357,"west":34.73892990000002,"north":-1.7116029,"east":37.412418}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/geocode-71.png","id":"c0a1562e9b66888a1a9321a78b3152c16fc8ae92","name":"Arusha Region","place_id":"ChIJAXA6kENnMRgRU0ESZivtD9c","reference":"CmRbAAAAoSaix2fxyejK49G-IE-2F7ZNFpRPJ3Bk2uWZy-bBb2gYaTiHcNBHTKAVRlQxPUghdjHrN4Ql79ucCt5CMexuiUpvIL8TWhGPFKW_EE1W14Za6sZMbMldmHO4lCcXoyvnEhBxHNyItQVE5PcbMg-GEEyVGhR-B3fwafMPDLzYqRuekj3Yvo8daw","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?q=Arusha+Region,+Tanzania&ftid=0x18316743903a7001:0xd70fed2b66124153","utc_offset":180,"html_attributions":[]},"__v":0,"last_updated":"2017-04-05T20:02:04.110Z","options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58d1f6ab9ee3b1226fb6c128","name":"Mayamiko Lab","related_set":"58d1f6262b434dae73859260","type":"manufacturing","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/kxh0zMgRNGIKVygbzMmg","https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/SvDL45raSRyDffdcWhGo","https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/8p9vFw3nQ3a4BATNFZex"],"videos":["bpuw3oXnkmg"],"what":"Full cut, make and trim (CMT)","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[33.7741195,-13.9626121]},"address":"Chinsapo, Lilongwe, Malawi","__v":4,"last_updated":"2017-04-05T20:02:18.486Z","description":"Established in 2013 by Paola Masperi, Mayamiko is a collection of clothing, accessories and home wares , ethically made in Malawi fusing together contemporary design with traditional African techniques.\n\nStand out from the fashion crowd in our fashion forward looks in stylish and bold traditional African printed cotton, known locally as chitenje, as well as other unique fabrics from neighbouring African countries, all sourced at the local market.
