We are committed to using New York State grown ingredients in our beers.  The majority of the barley we use is grown onsite here at Migliorelli Farm.  We also use hops from a variety of hop farms throughout New York State in our beer.  The brewery is located on the farm’s 100 acre orchard, which grows apples, pears, peaches, plums and cherries.  We age some of our beers on these fruits as well as an array of other local ingredients.\n\nFrom The Ground Brewery is a small brewery, now brewing on a 5 barrel system (155 gallons/batch).  But, we wish to stress that From The Ground Brewery brews to the standards and quality of the best big breweries.  For us, the best aspect of being small is the detailed attention every drop of beer receives, before it leaves the brewery. Watching our ingredients grow from the ground gives us an appreciation of our environment and what it provides. This beer begins in the ground and passes through the skilled hands of the farmer, the maltster, the brewer, and into the bottle. When you drink our beer, you will be happy to know that this beer was cared for at every stage of its production, from the ground to you.\n\nFrom The Ground Brewery is very blessed to be where it is today. Finding the right home has been a journey. A brewery relies heavily on agriculture to produce the best beers it can. Securing a home proximal to its raw ingredients, and their processing, clearly has benefits. Locating From The Ground Brewery at the agricultural source and immersing ourselves in the early crafting stages of our raw ingredients strengthens our model. In the years prior to opening, From The Ground Brewery has tested out 5 other homes. But each place required some compromise or sacrifice that threatened the vision.  It took determination and a lucky opportunity to find our current home at the heart of the Hudson River Valley on the hard-working Migliorelli family’s farm.\n\nJakob Cirell is the brewer and founder of From The Ground Brewery.  He grew up in the woods of central Maine with his mom, dad, 4 sisters, and brother. His parents built their small farm house off the grid. Given his dad didn’t like the taste of water run through a pipe, he made sure to not install a hand pump for running water. And so, at 10 years of age, Jakob began hauling the family’s daily lot of water, one 5 gallon bucket at a time from a well a ¼ mile away. He learned to cook on a wood stove and studied at night by kerosene lamp. This way of life took root in him and shaped his ideals for the design of everyday life. At 18, he left home for college at the University of Maine, where he earned a degree in Mechanical Engineering. After graduating, he soon moved to New York City to work as a mechanical engineer and then later as a brewer. After eight years of city life, he decided to move upstate and start a family. \n\nJakob dreamed up From The Ground Brewery, but it took lucky collaborations with a host of interesting people to extend his dream’s reach into reality. The majority of From The Ground Brewery’s raw ingredients are grown and processed within a 5-mile radius, and within this beer microcosm, he is creating a spirit of community. Throughout his study and immersion into advanced technology and living, he has never forgotten the joys of simplicity and the occasional hard work required to achieve it. Here is a picture of him with his eyes closed.","starred":true,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58db1e9a74cde9ce5c3ac5d4","name":"Green Wolf Brewing Co.","related_set":"58db1c43020e3e5666b983c5","type":"manufacturing","pictures":["https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/4iITW0dTSw2PE6UGUF1z"],"videos":[],"what":"Green Wolf Brewing Co.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.33508499999999,42.59796499999999],"place_id":"ChIJOWhUTIsu3IkRJeVsAhrP-HE"},"address":"315 Main St, Middleburgh, NY 12122, USA","google_places":{"address_components":[{"long_name":"315","short_name":"315","types":["street_number"]},{"long_name":"Main Street","short_name":"Main St","types":["route"]},{"long_name":"Middleburgh","short_name":"Middleburgh","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"Middleburgh","short_name":"Middleburgh","types":["administrative_area_level_3","political"]},{"long_name":"Schoharie County","short_name":"Schoharie County","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"New York","short_name":"NY","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"United States","short_name":"US","types":["country","political"]},{"long_name":"12122","short_name":"12122","types":["postal_code"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"street-address\">315 Main St</span>, <span class=\"locality\">Middleburgh</span>, <span class=\"region\">NY</span> <span class=\"postal-code\">12122</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">USA</span>","formatted_address":"315 Main St, Middleburgh, NY 12122, USA","geometry":{"location":{"lat":42.59796499999999,"lng":-74.33508499999999},"viewport":{"south":42.5967702197085,"west":-74.33622938029151,"north":42.5994681802915,"east":-74.33353141970849}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/geocode-71.png","id":"cdba4041f574d702eb1cd7adcce5a5eb060aa8ea","name":"315 Main St","place_id":"ChIJOWhUTIsu3IkRJeVsAhrP-HE","reference":"CmRbAAAAaKDXaWJaKL9nM17EKzTjuJ2eEcNPuOPyFOmTs45PqWmxi-In8uEDhT9SaGesaUdyvO43mD-CN044D4s7AGAd2VXES4EZ0ZI4e30ZRgoHIo3pkqpiM6AFRf-nZqjIv8dgEhDR5IV9xwypFimRRB0n-oP_GhTGhd7G69AoBW-5Q-ay1mDyfsGK5Q","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["street_address"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?q=315+Main+St,+Middleburgh,+NY+12122,+USA&ftid=0x89dc2e8b4c546839:0x71f8cf1a026ce525","utc_offset":-240,"vicinity":"Middleburgh","html_attributions":[]},"__v":1,"last_updated":"2017-03-29T21:08:51.469Z","description":"Mission\n \nGreen Wolf Brewing Co. is a licensed Farm Brewery located in the village of Middleburgh, NY – which is, in turn, located in scenic and historic Schoharie County. Schoharie County is within an hour’s drive of New York’s Capital District.\n\nOur uncommon ales are crafted with love and attention to detail, using local ingredients whenever possible. Green Wolf strives to create an interconnected web of farmers, local businesses, and beer enthusiasts within New York State’s Capital Region, so that we can build a thriving market for our artisan ales.\n\nArtisan Beer\n\nGreen Wolf will brew daring and uncommon beer – everything from bold and robust imperial porters, hop centric IPAs, Belgian inspired ales, and wheat beers. We will also develop a gluten free beer and non-alcoholic sodas.\n\nSustainability\n\nWe plan to present our sustainability sensibility front and center by working toward establishing ourselves as a carbon neutral brewery. As funding becomes available, Green Wolf has plans on installing a hot water solar thermal system to preheat water for our brew house.\n\nWe reuse our waste water. Farmers come by and pick up our spent grain to feed to their livestock. And we accept back our 22 ounce bottles – sanitize them, take off the old labels, then relabel and reuse.\n\nLocal Farms\n\nGreen Wolf will rely on locally grown and malted grains whenever possible. We also want New York hops in our beer and plan to order as much as possible from regional hops growers.\n\nBuilding Community\n\nGreen Wolf’s taproom will provide friends and neighbors with a place to relax and socialize. You will be able to listen to live music, play board games, bring in a meal from home or from one of the Main Street restaurants, or sit back and read a book. Along with having our beer available, we plan on serving coffee and tea.","starred":true,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58db20ade17d25055d846297","from_id":"58db1e21b4e427446d6cf625","to_id":"58db204fffdba3395cea735c","related_set":"58db1c43020e3e5666b983c5","type":"link","__v":0,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58db20ee1cc02f046dbfc869","from_id":"58db1d0eded15ea4666c7338","to_id":"58db1e21b4e427446d6cf625","related_set":"58db1c43020e3e5666b983c5","type":"link","__v":0,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58db1d0eded15ea4666c7338","name":"Coir","related_set":"58db1c43020e3e5666b983c5","type":"supplier","pictures":[],"videos":[],"what":"Coir","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[79.861243,6.9270786]},"address":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","__v":0,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58db1e9b020e3e5666b983c7","from_id":"58db1e21b4e427446d6cf625","to_id":"58db1e9a74cde9ce5c3ac5d4","related_set":"58db1c43020e3e5666b983c5","type":"link","__v":0,"options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"58db1f21778d74c866ece224","name":"Red Shed Brewing Co.","related_set":"58db1c43020e3e5666b983c5","type":"manufacturing","pictures":["https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/EH9bFEklSWuY4hnzB4ag"],"videos":[],"what":"Red Shed Brewing Co.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.809648,42.757276]},"address":"817 Butterbowl Road Cherry Valley NY 13320","__v":3,"last_updated":"2017-03-29T21:08:59.860Z","description":"Dedicated to handcrafted brew, made fresh...\n\nThe history of American hops farming in Otsego County is legendary.

On our original 10-gallon pilot system, we brewed and exclusively bottled flavor-forward, one-off batches, which we sold on-premises through our CSB membership program.  Founders Kyle Hurst and Scott Berger connected with local CSA (Community Shared Agriculture) and Food Co-ops to find local, fresh, and organic ingredients with the idea of preserving seasonal flavors through beer.\n\nSince 2013, we have opened a taproom for onsite drinking, expanded our brewing capacity, and now distribute throughout the five boroughs, Long Island, greater New York, and Massachusetts.  We are still committed to creative small-batches and continue to brew beers that challenge us and excite you.  \n\nWHAT IS A FARM BREWERY?\n\nAs a licensed New York State farm brewery, our beers support local and state agriculture.  We partner with state hop farmers and maltsters to source ingredients, and collaborate with local Queens businesses for specialty ingredients such as cold brew coffee, donuts, honey, and beyond.\n\nOUR NAME\n\nThe Queens skyline is marked by the four Ravenswood, red and white generator stacks.  The largest of these generators was built by the Milwaukee-based company, Allis-Chalmers.  In 1963 they operated the world’s largest generator producing enough units to serve 3,000,000 people.  Acknowledging the large population it served at the time, the Queens community nicknamed the generator ‘Big Allis’.  Our name honors a Queens landmark and connects us with the history and growth of our borough, and immediate neighborhood of Long Island City.","options":{"show_map":false}}]}
