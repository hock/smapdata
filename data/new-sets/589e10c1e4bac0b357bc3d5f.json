In the United States, sugarcane is grown commercially in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Hawaii.  The process of separating sugar from the sugarcane plant is accomplished in two steps:  crushing and refining.  Sugarcane is initially processed into raw sugar at mills near the cane fields since it is bulky and expensive to transport.  Also, it must be processed as soon as possible once harvested to minimize sugar deterioration.  The raw sugar is then sent to a refiner to be made into powdered sugar, granulated sugar and brown sugar (which contains some molasses).","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-92.0198427,30.2240897]},"__v":1,"last_updated":"2017-02-14T19:32:02.532Z","options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e0e655fd647f71e2b2109","name":"Cocoa Co-op","related_set":"589e10c1e4bac0b357bc3d5f","type":"cooperative","address":"San-Pédro, Côte d'Ivoire","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/KBKTGEGQvGZkiKQlhvNA"],"what":"Cocoa Co-op","description":"**COOPAOU Cocoa Cooperative**<p>\nIn 2012, The Hershey Company (Hershey) began its Learn to Grow (LTG) farmer training program with the objective of improving cocoa farm productivity and farmer livelihoods promoting greater farmer incomes and resulting investments in farming families.\n\nProject Objectives: Increase farmer production, invest in community development, actively engage in systems to improve labor practices.\n\n**Learn to Grow Cooperatives**: We encourage long-term commitment and investment in a sustainable supply chain and the development of strategic partnerships to improve the livelihoods of cocoa farmers and their communities.

The nuts are shelled, cleaned and sorted, and then sent to our West Hershey plant.  Our unique roasting process in sunflower oil ensures that the natural flavor of the almond is retained.","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-120.059879,36.72355719999999]},"__v":4,"last_updated":"2018-02-14T21:04:31.381Z","videos":["YsE486iM3eM"],"options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e1006cbccfc8774bed7e2","name":"Cocoa from Côte d'Ivoire to West Hershey Plant","from_id":"589e0e655fd647f71e2b2107","to":"West Hershey Plant","to_id":"589e0e64706e06361f35933e","related_set":"589e10c1e4bac0b357bc3d5f","type":"link","__v":0,"from":"Cocoa","options":{"show_map":true}},{"_id":"589e10c3d63e96d757b0d093","name":"Milk Fat","related_set":"589e10c1e4bac0b357bc3d5f","type":"supplier","address":"South Canterbury New Zealand","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/NhRbhhC8QGSgULrgfUFE"],"what":"Milk Fat","description":"Milk fat is the naturally occurring fat found in milk, and it is also sometimes referred to as butter fat.

Between 2010 and 2012, a new 340,000 sq. ft. expansion to the West Hershey facility was completed and the original 1905 factory was decommissioned and transformed into modern, LEED-certified office space.  The $300 million investment in the West Hershey plant features the latest manufacturing technology and equipment that speeds production, delivers consistent high quality, and provides the opportunity to produce new products in the future.  The new plant continues Hershey’s tradition as one of the few chocolate manufacturers in the U.S. to use fresh, liquid milk to ensure consistent high quality. There is also a fresh almond roasting plant onsite.  The West Hershey plant includes stainless steel corn syrup and fresh milk silos with the capacity to hold millions of pounds of ingredients.  All of the silos were manufactured in Lancaster County, PA.  The West Hershey facility is one of the company's eight manufacturing sites in the United States.

Cocoa beans are actually the fruit of the cacao tree, and come from pods that grow on the side of the trees.   Most of the world's cacao is grown in a narrow belt 10 degrees on either side of the Equator because the trees grow well in humid tropical climates with regular rains and a short dry season.  The main cocoa growing regions are West Africa (Cote D’Ivoire, Ghana, Cameroon and Nigeria), South America (Ecuador, Peru and Brazil), and Asia. The mature pods are harvested from the trees, split open and the cocoa beans and pulp removed.  They are fermented and dried, then shelled.  Most cocoa farms are small and family run, under 10 acres in size.  Hershey is committed to having 100% certified and sustainably sourced cocoa by 2020.","geometry":{"coordinates":[-1.6162709,6.6666004],"type":"Point"},"__v":2,"last_updated":"2017-02-14T19:38:25.046Z","videos":["koc3QW3jbsI"],"options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e10c3d63e96d757b0d094","name":"Cocoa Co-op","related_set":"589e10c1e4bac0b357bc3d5f","type":"cooperative","address":"Aboisso, Côte d'Ivoire","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/hAUxx5GvRwObgGablEGO"],"what":"Cocoa Co-op","description":"**CASMA Cocoa Cooperative**<p>\nIn 2012, The Hershey Company (Hershey) began its Learn to Grow (LTG) farmer training program with the objective of improving cocoa farm productivity and farmer livelihoods promoting greater farmer incomes and resulting investments in farming families.\n\nProject Objectives: Increase farmer production, invest in community development, actively engage in systems to improve labor practices.\n\n**Learn to Grow Cooperatives**: We encourage long-term commitment and investment in a sustainable supply chain and the development of strategic partnerships to improve the livelihoods of cocoa farmers and their communities.

We do occasionally have a need to source cane sugar from other regions in the world.  Our sugar comes from sugarcane, which is a non-GMO crop.  In the United States, sugarcane is grown commercially in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Hawaii.  The process of separating sugar from the sugarcane plant is accomplished in two steps:  crushing and refining.  Sugarcane is initially processed into raw sugar at mills near the cane fields since it is bulky and expensive to transport.  Also, it must be processed as soon as possible once harvested to minimize sugar deterioration.  The raw sugar is then sent to a refiner to be made into powdered sugar, granulated sugar and brown sugar (which contains some molasses).","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.71166699999999,26.609444]},"__v":1,"last_updated":"2017-02-14T19:42:30.229Z","options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"589e10c4890ff20658fb87ad","name":"Distance Learning","related_set":"589e10c1e4bac0b357bc3d5f","type":"project","address":"Assin Fosu, Ghana","pictures":["https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/Uj2jpCfHRxCt7hMKvMie","https://cdn.filepicker.io/api/file/zTNS1PnvRxedd6vK1DoL"],"what":"Distance Learning","description":"In 2012, The Hershey Company (Hershey) began its Learn to Grow (LTG) farmer training program with the objective of improving cocoa farm productivity and farmer livelihoods promoting greater farmer incomes and resulting investments in farming families.\n\nProject Objectives: Increase farmer production, invest in community development, actively engage in systems to improve labor practices.\n\n**Learn to Grow Distance Learning**: Hershey launched an innovative distance learning program to connect children in the U.S. and rural Ghana.
