Weaving baskets is a tradition in Taita culture. Hadithi baskets are made by weaver groups near Kasigau, South Eastern Kenya, in the villages of Makwasinyi, Buguta, Kiteghe, Rukanga, Jora, Bungule, Ngambenyi, Kisimenyi, Mwaktau, Bura (mkuyuni) and Mwatate. All these rural places are plagued by low rainfall and see many harvests fail.\n\nOver the years, selling the vyondo (baskets) has become an important income-generating activity that empowers the women in these communities. At the moment Hadithi works with over 400 weavers in the area.\n\nMaking baskets is a very labour intensive art. All these ladies weave baskets with their self-twined and self-dyed sisal string. This sisal grows in the fields belonging to these women. They make use of both natural dyes and commercial dyes. The ‘Taita Traditional’ range comprises of baskets that are entirely woven with naturally dyed sisal – derived from tree barks, soil and flowers. All the bright colours are obtained using commercial permanent textile dyes.","last_updated":"2018-05-01T14:03:20.454Z","foot_note":"Discover more: https://www.hadithikenya.com/","options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"5abc9f8ccd28ecc7711d239f","name":"Olonana Womens Group","related_set":"57f64cd59486a032243db5bc","type":"artisangroup","pictures":["https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/fH10Sw4wTTWXJ9uTCoFJ","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/QEIsezOzQ0G90AsOV2yA","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/x0fUeOArRYyZqPJtEJmi","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/kT4mK1ZDRhuu7knEhvJL","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/340H6XSQ3azfse3O1wbU","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/VPc0qecXTwyMmsf8kIiG","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/BlBTPztzRGOSKFxcIYob","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/7r69Bst2TRaOpgbxaY8S"],"videos":[],"what":"Beadwork","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.69365119999998,-1.4251869],"place_id":"ChIJEVuQESUBLxgRxHC_syKi8t0"},"address":"Kiserian, Kenya","google_places":{"address_components":[{"long_name":"Kiserian","short_name":"Kiserian","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"Kajiado County","short_name":"Kajiado County","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"Kenya","short_name":"KE","types":["country","political"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"locality\">Kiserian</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">Kenya</span>","formatted_address":"Kiserian, Kenya","geometry":{"location":{"lat":-1.4251869,"lng":36.69365119999998},"viewport":{"south":-1.4385427,"west":36.681117900000004,"north":-1.4156359,"east":36.703830299999936}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/geocode-71.png","id":"0662ca01a72b6d4b6d74722ee383814d32218a27","name":"Kiserian","place_id":"ChIJEVuQESUBLxgRxHC_syKi8t0","reference":"CmRbAAAAMO2zrCk4N8PxrztAS7P5gnmZj6iPhtJcOG_uhJOLa7RHMYdORu6VIkTrZTvY9SOcIOS4oRzRV-ug1aTVTiqmMet7KnYnNQnTXBWOcVNPxWL_4uhQ3Paa9j61iTBVoNNREhA7EvWQWFlmiROrs2gao0WfGhTWs3ScYOfuzSGfsUB3vG-JuPxxeA","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["locality","political"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?q=Kiserian,+Kenya&ftid=0x182f012511905b11:0xddf2a222b3bf70c4","utc_offset":180,"vicinity":"Kiserian","html_attributions":[]},"__v":2,"last_updated":"2018-05-01T14:13:35.216Z","description":"A group of 20 women specialising in traditional Kenyan beadwork. \nThe women work together to earn enough money to afford sanitary towels for their daughters who otherwise would drop out of school.\n\nFounded in 2009, the group started collaborating with Artisan.Fashion, EFI's partner brand in Kenya, the same year.","foot_note":"Discover more: http://artisan.fashion/","options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"5abb59871464969b46b6f569","name":"Sanata Womens Self-help group","related_set":"57f64cd59486a032243db5bc","type":"artisangroup","pictures":["https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/87ULs6j7Ryu4EAZUM6XN","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/hpF7KdjQ9PHkIQnNkEg1","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/YUrdvNPbTwmlyKHFDue5","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/6UtF1MWxSaGTIV1EM25W","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/UkYyQsOpRrGEtC1YoklG","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/54nuuvnWT4Gc5Y6EZG7w","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/0vSwMKObTwu3e4PJwTTf","https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/tu57xxQSUehJmOWwuTdh"],"videos":[],"what":"Bead work, screen-printing","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[36.31729930000006,-0.4922735],"place_id":"ChIJ8-v_FkYKKRgRmd7WG13L_IQ"},"address":"Gilgil, Kenya","google_places":{"address_components":[{"long_name":"Gilgil","short_name":"Gilgil","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"Nakuru County","short_name":"Nakuru County","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"Kenya","short_name":"KE","types":["country","political"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"locality\">Gilgil</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">Kenya</span>","formatted_address":"Gilgil, Kenya","geometry":{"location":{"lat":-0.4922735,"lng":36.31729930000006},"viewport":{"south":-0.5263064,"west":36.294880000000035,"north":-0.4686301999999999,"east":36.34483350000005}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/geocode-71.png","id":"81d1c167add848556e34aa269e8710ad8798bd40","name":"Gilgil","place_id":"ChIJ8-v_FkYKKRgRmd7WG13L_IQ","reference":"CmRbAAAAgrvHAGNmMVKvkhNwA4w76gIjdvEvhHDxpqcN7r55MxbwD6xFJZI8-jj0on4DZaUn-jxqtBNKZRBXPccQ9CK3RocBW23DgsVGVlST8gnptGaSbOoMqavtxYT7oRBb84fcEhA2abRzoif-KHXtYoAfbjJ3GhTJc0rDzErJjtg6KyerjTFy7ampwA","scope":"GOOGLE","types":["locality","political"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?q=Gilgil,+Kenya&ftid=0x18290a4616ffebf3:0x84fccb5d1bd6de99","utc_offset":180,"vicinity":"Gilgil","html_attributions":[]},"__v":4,"last_updated":"2018-05-01T14:04:31.349Z","description":"Sanata is a self-help group of 29 members that was formed as a result of the post-election violence in 2008.

It is located along Jalalabad road in Kabul, Afghanistan. The entity was founded in 2010 by three socially-conscious entrepreneurs when Afghanistan at the time was one of the most inaccessible countries in the world. The company invested a fortune replanting the native nut trees to maintain what was notably a lifeblood of the country. Their aim was to go beyond supporting the agricultural economy, but bypass corrupt middlemen and reach out to local farmers and women directly. What started with almonds expanded into other rare and heirloom nuts and fruits. \nZiba foods LLC, employs12 workers and sourcing regularly from 300 farmers.

However, a few artisans processing silk are the only ones left to preserve a century old silk production. One of the few workshops processing silk out of locally grown cocoons is Amir Abbas led by a well-known Mr. Haji Latif, a key player in the sector with whom EFI had outlined the general terms of a business plan on setting up a spinning facility. The workshop employs approximately twelve people, including spinners with unique knowledge in manual spinning technics. \n\nThe company has been unable to satisfy a huge market demand of raw silk yarn in Herat, Mazar-i- Sharif and Kabul. Its capacities are reduced by three factors: lack of productive equipment, constraints of space and local market not sufficient to support it due to imported synthetic silk saturating the local market. \n\nThe workshop produces outstanding products: pure silk yarn, suitable for luxury productions. Even more beautiful is the yarn developed out of the parts of cocoons that remain after the first round of processing and that are traditionally considered a form of waste. They are spun again to produce a different and thicker kind of yarn.","options":{"show_map":false}},{"_id":"5c8fc72864b4643c4b687379","name":"UNDP","related_set":"57f64cd59486a032243db5bc","type":"developmentagency","pictures":[],"videos":[],"what":"Security and logistics","geometry":{"coordinates":[69.207486,34.5553494],"type":"Point"},"address":"Kabul, Afghanistan","google_places":{"address_components":[{"long_name":"Kabul","short_name":"Kabul","types":["locality","political"]},{"long_name":"Parki Sanayi Kochak","short_name":"Parki Sanayi Kochak","types":["sublocality_level_1","sublocality","political"]},{"long_name":"Kabul","short_name":"Kabul","types":["administrative_area_level_2","political"]},{"long_name":"Kabul","short_name":"Kabul","types":["administrative_area_level_1","political"]},{"long_name":"Afghanistan","short_name":"AF","types":["country","political"]}],"adr_address":"<span class=\"locality\">Kabul</span>, <span class=\"country-name\">Afghanistan</span>","formatted_address":"Kabul, Afghanistan","geometry":{"location":{"lat":34.5472298,"lng":69.27574890000005},"viewport":{"south":34.5458829197085,"west":69.27427261970843,"north":34.54858088029149,"east":69.2769705802915}},"icon":"https://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/place_api/icons/generic_business-71.png","id":"78e4c80a6663b05f01f8ddb9a23bd4ce5dacbebe","name":"UNOCA Compound","place_id":"ChIJ689ggKVs0TgRuabFfBbPidg","plus_code":{"compound_code":"G7WG+V7 Kabul, Afghanistan","global_code":"8J6FG7WG+V7"},"rating":4.5,"reference":"ChIJ689ggKVs0TgRuabFfBbPidg","reviews":[{"author_name":"Ali Bakhsh Nasrat","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110768969423842129173/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CxYgNCckaSw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAhY/UIHpxZ1XpKA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"The place is with high security where international employee are working for development of the country.","time":1545307522},{"author_name":"Haji Mohammad","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105581881506979782128/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-z6sM4gWhaRc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/KNLHLor_sFE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"It has very good facilities","time":1547263137},{"author_name":"Anthony Bunce","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112003311402511516548/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-21ScjbtRSSQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEBY/cDH2WkXhyM4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"9 months ago","text":"The best compound to be.
